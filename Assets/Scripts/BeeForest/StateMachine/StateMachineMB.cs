    /// A State Machine can be in one of a finite number of states. It can change from one state to
    /// another based on different kind of inputs. Each state the State Machine can transition to is handled
    /// by its own classes.
	/// The State Machine inherits MonoBehaviour to easily implement Component-based functionality.
    ///
    /// In order to implement this StateMachine, the following things are required:
    /// Create a Controller that inherits from StateMachine.
    /// Create the State classes that inherit from the State interface.
    /// Implement the required functions in the new State classes.
    /// Create the instances of the State classes in the new controller.
    /// Using ChangeState(state) the states in the controller can be changed.
    /// If the States need more information, it's possible to pass them down in the Constructor when the Controller initializes them.
